Robo Drupal8 Builder
====================

This repository contains various Robo tasks for build and rebuild your project [Drupal8](https://www.drupal.org/) with [Robo](http://robo.li/) through simplified configuration file.
This code method (defined idea of functionality) is experimental.

See [drupal-robo-project](https://github.com/lucacracco/drupal-robo-project) for example.

The implementation uses [Robo Drush Extension](https://github.com/boedah/robo-drush) for integration with [Drush](http://www.drush.org/en/master/) and [Robo](http://robo.li/).

**Note**: only version `~1.0` of Robo.
